                    About two years ago, several game updates brought a flood of information. In the midst of my busy life, I had to spend a lot of time searching for details on various community channels, but the information was scattered and hard to track. This inspired me to create a clear and streamlined format for update articles. I referred to the classification methods used by some information enthusiasts and began my journey of posting updates. Initially, I presented the content as simple information briefs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Later, I had the privilege of discovering yuki's database, which made searching for information and data extremely easy. For someone who wants to deeply explore or design the game, having a clear and aesthetically pleasing layout is crucial, and the database provides more than just basic information.
                </p>

                <p>
                    About a year ago, I started automating the production of these information briefs, but many problems still remained. I did not have enough time to maintain the complex code I had hastily written. To make updates more automated, I decided to build this website. Initially, I never intended to create a full-fledged database. However, recently I learned that yuki's database is retiring, which made it urgent for me to build a database to fill this huge gap.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For me, reliance on database information goes far beyond simply playing the game, so I embarked on this massive project. Creating a database is not just about uploading data and formatting it—it requires building an entire ecosystem, including automated updates, maintainable code, effective information channels, and accurate parsing. It is an extremely demanding task. The key is not whether it is difficult or easy, but that this effort yields no tangible benefit; it is driven solely by passion.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Fortunately, I was not starting from scratch. The groundbreaking example set by the strongest Battle Cats database reduced the difficulty of creation and enabled me to build this database. I started from my own requirements, and if the information provided by this database is helpful to others, I am more than happy. Welcome to use it.
